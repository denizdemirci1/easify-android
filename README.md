# Easify-v2

A self-study app to practise on Advanced Android Development. This project aims to improve
Easify-v1 technically and logically.

In this project I aim to use new tools and techniques I learned since the time of
Easify-v1. Here is a list of what this project will contain:

- Jetpack: Coroutines, LiveData, DataBinding, Navigation, Paging3...

- Continuous Integration using Jenkins

- Ktlint for pretty coding

- Unit Tests and UI Tests: MockK, Espresso

- Dagger Hilt Dependency Injection

- Material Design

- Animations & Transitions

and many more to find along the way. The sky still remains being the limit.
